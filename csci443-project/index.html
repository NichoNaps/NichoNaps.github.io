    <h1>The Un-Subscribe Website</h1>

    <h2>Stage 1: Empathy</h2>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Every day consumers are on the front lines against antagonistic UX designed to make it a challenging as possible
      to cancel subscriptions and put in the unreasonable position to decipher the gotchas of lengthy EULAs. I plan to design an
      website to aggregate, curate, update and make easily accessible instructions for canceling subscriptions as well as warn
      users about large gotchas in EULAs. A great example of EULA gotcha is Adobes 50% cancellation fee after
      14 days. The hope is that you could send a link to an instruction article on this website to even non-technical users and they could
      follow along to cancel a subscription.
    </p>
    <h3>Interviewee Selection</h3>
    <p>
      My goal is to provide this app to people with many subscriptions to reduce the hasle of managing them all and to those that would struggle more with 
      canceling subscriptions such as older people. According to a study from 2022, music subscriptions,
       are about equally popular between 18-34 and 35-54 age ranges (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1376840/music-services-subscriptions-age-united-states/">Statista</a>).
      Video streaming subscriptions however are even more popular with younger 
      generations with 70% of 18-34 year olds to 43% of > 55 year olds reporting that they had a Netflix subscription in 2024 (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1197902/paid-video-streaming-subscribers-us-age/">Statista</a>).
      As a result, I plan to target some younger people between 18-35 as well as some older people between 35-55 so I can both capture the younger people that have many subscriptions and the older people that might have more difficulty even with fewer subscriptions.

    <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
    <p>
      Below are the questions I asked in each interview. Some of these questions can technically be answered with a simple yes no so I made sure to 
      ask follow up questions if needed so they would describe the specifics behind their answer such as why they would not read an entire EULA.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do find some interfaces annoying? if so, what's an example?</li>
      <li>Do you have any subscriptions? if so, what's are some examples?</li>
      <li>Have you every encountered issues while canceling a subscription?</li>
      <li>If there was an app that would walk you through canceling a subscription would you use it?</li>
      <li>How would you describe your tolerance for ads on websites?</li>
      <li>Have you ever needed to lookup how to cancel a subscription?</li>
      <li>Have you ever read a EULA?</li>
      <li>Have you ever felt you werent informed about an important part of the EULA? if so, what's an example?</li>
      <li>Do you know someone who you think would have difficulty canceling a subscription?</li>
    </ul>
