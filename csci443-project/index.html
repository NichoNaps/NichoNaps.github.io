    <h1>The Un-Subscribe Website</h1>
    <p>Emery C</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Stage 1: Empathy</h2>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Every day consumers are on the front lines against antagonistic UX designed to make it a challenging as possible
      to cancel subscriptions and put in the unreasonable position to decipher the gotchas of lengthy EULAs. I plan to
      design an
      website to aggregate, curate, update and make easily accessible instructions for canceling subscriptions as well
      as warn
      users about large gotchas in EULAs. A great example of EULA gotcha is Adobes 50% cancellation fee after
      14 days. The hope is that you could send a link to an instruction article on this website to even non-technical
      users and they could
      follow along to cancel a subscription.
    </p>
    <h3>Interviewee Selection</h3>
    <p>
      My goal is to provide this app to people with many subscriptions to reduce the hasle of managing them all and to
      those that would struggle more with canceling subscriptions such as older people. Using this goal I have created
      the following target demographics for the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at age ranges, according to a study from 2022, music subscriptions,
      are about equally popular between 18-34 and 35-54 age ranges (<a
        href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1376840/music-services-subscriptions-age-united-states/">Statista</a>).
      Video streaming subscriptions however are even more popular with younger
      generations with 70% of 18-34 year olds to 43% of > 55 year olds reporting that they had a Netflix subscription in
      2024 (<a
        href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1197902/paid-video-streaming-subscribers-us-age/">Statista</a>).
      As a result, I plan to target some younger people between 18-35 as well as some older people between 35-55 so I
      can both capture the younger people that have many subscriptions and the older people that might have more
      difficulty even with fewer subscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for gender, men typically have a few more subscriptions than woman (<a
        href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/a-closer-look-at-the-media-subscription-gender-gap-01604952130">WSJ</a>)
      so I've oppted to interview 3 men and 2 woman. This way I can interview more people that likely have more
      subscriptions.
    </p>

    <h4>I collected the following demographic information on the interview participants:</h4>

    <p>For the ages, as planned, I interviewed 3 younger people (ages 18-33) as well as 2 older people (ages 49-63)</p>

    <p>I interviewed 3 men and 2 woman as planned.</p>
    <img src="demographics-graphs/gender.png" class="mb-3" style="width:100%; max-width: 800px;">
    <p>
      Lastly, I couldn't find any information on how education level correlates to number of subscriptions but I thought
      it was important to collect.
      This was because I interviewed many college students since they are the most availiable to me to interview.
      This makes my interview pool highly skewed in favor of people with or in the progress of getting a college degree
      which I felt was important to disclose as it may affect how representable the interview pool is.

    <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
    <p>
      Below are the questions I asked in each interview. Some of these questions can technically be answered with a
      simple yes no so I made sure to
      ask follow up questions if needed so they would describe the specifics behind their answer such as why they would
      not read an entire EULA.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do find some interfaces annoying? if so, what's an example?</li>
      <li>Do you have any subscriptions? if so, what's are some examples?</li>
      <li>Have you every encountered issues while canceling a subscription?</li>
      <li>If there was an app that would walk you through canceling a subscription would you use it?</li>
      <li>How would you describe your tolerance for ads on websites?</li>
      <li>Have you ever needed to lookup how to cancel a subscription?</li>
      <li>Have you ever read a EULA?</li>
      <li>Have you ever felt you werent informed about an important part of the EULA? if so, what's an example?</li>
      <li>Do you know someone who you think would have difficulty canceling a subscription?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>


      <!-- -- The thoughts toward using an instructional website were mixed.
      One concern was that having to using this website wouldn't actually make things faster/easier to cancel becuase it
      would mean dealing with another website.
      It could maybe make things easier but a lot of people are already sufficiently motivated to trudge through
      antagonistic UI/UX to cancel things because it
      means saving money. I think the more resources the better, and being very easy to follow -->
