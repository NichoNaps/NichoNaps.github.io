    <h1>The Unsubscribe Website</h1>
    <p>Emery C</p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="stage-1">Stage 1: Empathy</h2>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Every day consumers are on the front lines against antagonistic UX designed to make it a challenging as possible
      to cancel subscriptions and put in the unreasonable position to decipher the gotchas of lengthy EULAs (End User
      License Agreement). I plan to
      design an
      website to aggregate, curate, update and make easily accessible instructions for canceling subscriptions as well
      as warn
      users about large gotchas in EULAs. A great example of EULA gotcha is Adobes 50% cancellation fee after
      14 days. The hope is that you could send a link to an instruction article on this website to even non-technical
      users and they could
      follow along to cancel a subscription.
    </p>
    <h3>Interviewee Selection</h3>
    <p>
      My goal is to provide this app to people with many subscriptions to reduce the hassle of managing them all and to
      those that would struggle more with canceling subscriptions such as older people. Using this goal I have created
      the following target demographics for the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at age ranges, according to a study from 2022, music subscriptions,
      are about equally popular between 18-34 and 35-54 age ranges (<a
        href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1376840/music-services-subscriptions-age-united-states/">Statista</a>).
      Video streaming subscriptions however are even more popular with younger
      generations with 70% of 18-34 year olds to 43% of > 55 year olds reporting that they had a Netflix subscription in
      2024 (<a
        href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1197902/paid-video-streaming-subscribers-us-age/">Statista</a>).
      As a result, I plan to target some younger people between 18-35 as well as some older people between 35-55 so I
      can both capture the younger people that have many subscriptions and the older people that might have more
      difficulty even with fewer subscriptions. I could try having an even older group that would have more difficulty
      canceling subscriptions but I have limited time and the number of elderly that would be able to use an external
      website for help when they are also struggling with unsubscribing so much is probably pretty small.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for gender, men typically have a few more subscriptions than woman (<a
        href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/a-closer-look-at-the-media-subscription-gender-gap-01604952130">WSJ</a>)
      so I've opted to interview 3 men and 2 woman. This way I can interview more people that likely have more
      subscriptions.
    </p>

    <p>For the ages, as planned, I interviewed 3 younger people (ages 18-33) as well as 2 older people (ages 49-63)</p>
    <img src="demographics-graphs/age.png" class="my-img">
    <p>I also interviewed 3 men and 2 woman as planned.</p>
    <img src="demographics-graphs/gender.png" class="my-img">
    <p>
      Lastly, I couldn't find any information on how education level correlates to number of subscriptions but I thought
      it was important to collect.
      This was because I interviewed many college students since they are the most available to me to interview.
      This makes my interview pool highly skewed in favor of people with or in the progress of getting a college degree.
      I felt it was important to disclose this as it may affect how representable the interview pool is.
    </p>

    <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
    <p>
      Below are the questions I asked in each interview. Some of these questions can technically be answered with a
      simple yes no so I made sure to
      ask follow up questions if needed so they would describe the specifics behind their answer such as why they would
      not read an entire EULA.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do find some interfaces annoying? if so, what's an example?</li>
      <li>Do you have any subscriptions? if so, what's are some examples?</li>
      <li>Have you every encountered issues while canceling a subscription?</li>
      <li>If there was an app that would walk you through canceling a subscription would you use it?</li>
      <li>How would you describe your tolerance for ads on websites?</li>
      <li>Have you ever needed to lookup how to cancel a subscription?</li>
      <li>Have you ever read a EULA?</li>
      <li>Have you ever felt you weren't informed about an important part of the EULA? if so, what's an example?</li>
      <li>Do you know someone who you think would have difficulty canceling a subscription?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>

      Looking over the interviews and empathy maps I've come up with the following key insights:
    <ul>
      <li>Most people would be open to using a website that helps unsubscribe from things as long as it actually saves
        time in the end to have to go to this extra website.</li>
      <li>Some people have reported that they have resorted to getting help unsubscribing from something from things
        from various sources.</li>
      <li>No one really reads EULAs but sometimes they would like to know some of its terms like what they do with your
        user data so you are more informed about what you are signing up for.</li>
      <li>People are indeed motivated to cancel unneeded subscriptions despite the often difficulty of doing so because
        it saves them money.</li>
      <li>Most people had at least one especially bad experience canceling a subscription where money was or was almost
        lost and the process was frustrating.</li>
      <li>Unsubscribing often isn't easy and is sometimes even broken.</li>
      <li>Everything thinks that their grandparents/elderly people (> 60) will struggle a lot with canceling
        subscriptions.</li>
      <li>Everyone would like it if unsubscribing was easier but companies have the complete opposite incentive.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What surprised me the most but in retrospect is very obvious was that while this website may help, people are
      already very
      sufficiently motivated to figure out unsubscribing because it saves them money. Meaning, that a lot of people will
      figure out
      how to unsubscribe even if it takes them a while to wade through whatever antagonistic/broken UI is thrown their
      way.
      What this website I'm proposing would need to do then to help users that would have figured it out eventually is
      to have unparalleled ease of use
      and searchability in order to actually save them time.
    </p>

    <p>
      One way you could try making it save more time is that instead of being a separate website with screenshoted steps
      of
      what you need to do I could instead provide a browser extension. The extension could walk you through the UI of
      the
      actual unsubscribe webpage by just pointing to the next button to press.
      This would counteract any dark patterns in the most literal way possible by turning them into light patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other use of the website, to provide EULA gotchas still seems applicable to all users no matter their ability
      to
      eventually unsubscribe because no one really reads EULAs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, It didn't seem like the older people I interviewed (ages 49 - 63) had significantly more issues than the
      younger group but
      both were more open to external resources like getting help from other people or tools to deal with unsubscribing
      (Apple).
      This indicates that people in the 49 - 63 age range might be more open to using the website I'm proposing than the
      younger group
      which seemed more willing to take on unsubscribing unassisted.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 id="stage-2">Stage 2: Define</h2>

    <h3>Persona</h3>
    <p>
      For the persona, I decided it represents someone with at least 3 subscriptions. This is because people in the
      interviews were very
      conscious of money wasted by unused subscriptions and the more subscriptions likely the more they have to
      occasionally cancel.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the age, younger people might have more subscriptions necessitating more unsubscribing when they aren't in use
      but older people seems to be more open to using external tools for assistance so I decided to pick 40 years old.
      This is because while I didn't interview a 40 year old it is in the middle between the young and older
      interviewees to hopefully strike a balance between people with more subscriptions and those that would be more
      open to using a website for assistance.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the rest of the fields about story and attitudes I filled them in based on similar experiences and attitudes
      found in the empathy maps and interviews. In particular, in the story section I included a bad experience with a
      subscription
      just like how most interviewees had one really bad experience with subscriptions.
    </p>

    </div>


    <h3>Business Model Canvas</h3>
    <p>
      For the business model I extrapolated sources of costs a website like this would need to pay such as webhosting
      and keeping the information up to date as subscriptions change. I also brainstormed some potential revenue streams
      such as advertisements made on the website and a generous free tier for the number subscriptions you can
      unsubscribe from
      using the extension followed by a pay as you go model. I think this strikes a good freemium model that will work
      well with
      the likely money conscious users making use of this website and extension.
    </p>
    <img src="stage2/business-plan.svg" class="my-img">

    <br>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      In summary, the app will target the persona of a consumers with 3 or more subscriptions, who are money conscious
      enough to want to unsubscribe
      from subscriptions not in use and or who want to be alerted to gotchas in EULAs. This website aims to help these
      people by reducing
      the time and frustration associated with these two types of tasks. For some people it may even mean saving some
      money if they weren't going to
      cancel a subscription without assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business plan for making this financial viable is a freemium model. Its important that we provide generous
      free with ads material so we won't turn away our target user because they are money conscious.
    </p>

    <h2 id="stage-3">Stage 3: Ideate</h2>
    <h3>Mind Map</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xl-6 mb-3">
    <p>
      For ideation I elected to use a mind map. This is because I have used mind maps in the past to great success for
      arranging my thoughts on complex topics while studying. I have however not used them specifically for
      brainstorming ideas so I though it would be interesting to try mind mapping out in this new setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like with mind maps I've previously created, I built them within Obsidian. This let me color connections like a
      green arrow between canceling subscriptions and money indicating that canceling subscriptions saves you money. I
      used red however to indicate a more bad relationship like how frustration is red and so is all connections into
      it. It also let me insert images, including some stock images from pixabay. I used these images to add emphasis
      like representing EULAs with an image of a large stack of paper or frustration with a frustrated looking person.
      After starting with the unsubscribe website, and then the two main uses cases of the unsubscribe assistant and
      EULA gotchas I began to come up with a few new ideas for connections. One of these was why limit the browser
      extension to just housing the unsubscribe assistant when it could also provide access to EULA gotchas information.
    </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-xl-6 mb-3">
        <img src="stage3/mindmap.png" class="my-img">
      </div>
    </div>  


    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      I came into ideation a bit skeptical as to whether I would come up with anything novel but the exercise did help me 
      come up with a few additional ideas below:
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, I realized that the browser extension could, in addition to housing the unsubscribe assistant tool, show
      you EULA gotchas when you go to a page to sign up for
      a subscription. This way you don't even have to leave the subscription's signup page to be presented with any noteworthy
      information about the service's EULA. I think it would still be worthwhile to make the EULA gotcha
      summaries available on the unsubscribe website itself but this opens up another convenient use case of having the extensions installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing I realized is really important is user feedback. The reason for this is because while we can try to
      keep information updated as best we can, any one of the subscriptions we have information on could change that
      information at any moment so we will always be fighting an uphill battle to stay accurate. Thus, its important
      that users are able to flag something as suspect so we can respond to it more rapidly. Take Amazon for example. If 
      one day they change their unsubscribe page breaking the unsubscribe assistant without us knowing then users need an
      easy to report that their is a problem. This also goes for the EULA gotchas which will change as companies change their 
      EULAs.
    </p>
