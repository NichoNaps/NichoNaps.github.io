I like to occasionally game, walk, drink
            lots of coffee and main Linux. I also love to tinker with all things
            software. As an example, I built a home lab out of an old computer
            with TrueNAS scale for family photo backups and my own little todo
            app in Rust hosted on a Raspberry PI over a VPN.</p> <p class="svelte-1l7s19c">I'm really fascinated by programming language design and love trying
            out new language features such as Python's new walrus and matching
            features.</p></div> <div class="col-xl-4 svelte-1l7s19c"><div class="profile-img profile-coffee mb-3 svelte-1l7s19c"><div class="image-title-center svelte-1l7s19c"><i class="bi bi-cup-hot svelte-1l7s19c" style="font-size: 100px;"></i></div></div></div></div> <br class="svelte-1l7s19c"> <hr class="svelte-1l7s19c"> <div class="row mt-5 svelte-1l7s19c"><div class="col-xl-4 svelte-1l7s19c"><div class="profile-img profile-dog mb-3 svelte-1l7s19c"><div class="image-title-center svelte-1l7s19c"></div></div></div> <div class="col-xl-8 svelte-1l7s19c"><h3 class="mt-0 svelte-1l7s19c">Experience</h3> <p class="svelte-1l7s19c">Currently, I'm a student employee for CatTracks where we use a LAMP
            stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). A lot of my time is spent reading
            and fixing legacy code but its helped me learn the importance of
            documentation and writing readable code for those that will come
            after me.</p> <p class="svelte-1l7s19c">And here's a cute photo of a Mini Australian Shepard!</p></div></div> <br class="svelte-1l7s19c">`,1);function n(e){var s=i();a(8),l(e,s)}export{n as component};
