    to make it a challenging as possible to cancel subscriptions and put in the
    unreasonable position to decipher the gotchas of lengthy EULAs (End User
    License Agreement). As part of a college UI/UX design project I designed a
    website and accompanying extension to warn users about large gotchas in
    EULAs as well as walk you through unsubscribing.</p> <p>Below is a summary of the process but you can also checkout the <a href="./full/">full report here!</a></p> <p>Tools Used: <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Obsidian</span> <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Figma</span> <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Draw.io</span> <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Pixabay</span> <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Goodnotes</span> <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Google Forms</span></p> <p></p> <h2>Discovery Processes</h2> <div class="row mt-5"><div class="col-xl-6"><h3 class="mt-0">1. Surveys</h3> <p>Before designing the app, I interviewed 5 people and created empathy
            maps to gain a better understanding of users needs. This helped me
            realize the need for speed which brought about the inception of the
            accompanying browser extension which would allow users to
            unsubscribe blazing fast by simply pointing them to the next button
            to click.</p></div> <div class="col-xl-6"><div class="row"><div class="col-xl-6"><img class="mb-3 my-img"></div> <div class="col-xl-6"><img class="my-img"></div></div></div></div> <div class="row mt-5"><div class="col-xl-6"><h3 class="mt-0">2. Ideation</h3> <p>Armed with empathy maps and personas I brainstormed all of the
            elements my app had and how they are related. This useful to get all
            of the features and concerns out on paper so problems like missing
            functionality implied by other features isn't missed. I used a mind
            map for this process because it emulates how humans think.</p></div> <div class="col-xl-6"><img class="my-img"></div></div> <div class="row mt-5"><div class="col-xl-6"><h3 class="mt-0">3. Low Fidelity Prototyping</h3> <p>I then started sketching out possible UIs that would fulfill the
            ideas I came up with. Importantly, this step is still very ruff
            allowing for easy adjustment and refinement as I develop how this
            app could look and function. During this step I also began to use
            various UX laws like Fitts Law and the Nielsen Useability Heuristics
            to create more affective UX.</p></div> <div class="col-xl-6"><img class="my-img"></div></div> <div class="row mt-5"><div class="col-xl-6"><h3 class="mt-0">4. High Fidelity Prototyping</h3> <p>After getting a pretty good of how things could work using low
            fidelity prototyping I built a interactive prototype using Figma.
            This step is crucial to assist with user testing as well as ensure
            the user experience through the app makes sense. Once such mistake I
            caught was that it was difficult to go back to the extension home
            from the page viewing an extension so I added a home button for
            easier navigation.</p> <p>You can checkout the interactive prototype below:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/4uFmT7quSmFAXhwhCs7ORn/csci443?node-id=1-3&amp;node-type=canvas&amp;t=pHQ5Of9pPDP0c5KP-1&amp;scaling=scale-down&amp;content-scaling=fixed&amp;page-id=0%3A1&amp;starting-point-node-id=1%3A3">The Unsubscribe Website</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/4uFmT7quSmFAXhwhCs7ORn/csci443?node-id=18-9395&amp;node-type=frame&amp;t=xHUKJaHaw1HolPii-1&amp;scaling=scale-down&amp;content-scaling=fixed&amp;page-id=0%3A1&amp;starting-point-node-id=1%3A3">The Extension</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.figma.com/design/4uFmT7quSmFAXhwhCs7ORn/csci443?node-id=0-1&amp;t=uZs2Ze2bVvSAHGIs-1">The Entire Figma Project Itself</a></li></ul></div> <div class="col-xl-6"><div class="row"><div class="col-xl-6"><img class="mb-3 my-img"></div> <div class="col-xl-6"><img class="my-img"></div></div></div></div> <br> <br> <br> <p>Checkout the <a href="./full/">full report for this project here!</a></p> <br style="margin-top: 200px;">`,1);function Os(w,x){fs(x,!1);const I=Object.assign({"./full/assets/demographics-graphs/age.png":q,"./full/assets/demographics-graphs/education.png":C,"./full/assets/demographics-graphs/gender.png":D,"./full/assets/empathy-maps/caden.svg":L,"./full/assets/empathy-maps/elsie.svg":S,"./full/assets/empathy-maps/emmet.svg":G,"./full/assets/empathy-maps/george.svg":z,"./full/assets/empathy-maps/valerie.svg":B,"./full/assets/stage2/business-plan.svg":R,"./full/assets/stage2/persona-page1.svg":K,"./full/assets/stage2/persona-page2.svg":Z,"./full/assets/stage3/mindmap.png":J,"./full/assets/stage4/low-fidelity.png":N,"./full/assets/stage4/u1.png":Q,"./full/assets/stage4/u10.png":V,"./full/assets/stage4/u101.png":W,"./full/assets/stage4/u12.png":Y,"./full/assets/stage4/u13.png":M,"./full/assets/stage4/u2.png":$,"./full/assets/stage4/u3.png":ss,"./full/assets/stage4/u32.png":es,"./full/assets/stage4/u4.png":as,"./full/assets/stage4/u5.png":ts,"./full/assets/stage4/u6.png":is,"./full/assets/stage4/u62.png":ls,"./full/assets/stage4/u7.png":os,"./full/assets/stage4/u9.png":gs,"./full/assets/stage5/image1.png":ns,"./full/assets/stage5/image2.png":_s,"./full/assets/stage5/image3.png":ps,"./full/assets/stage5/image4.png":rs,"./full/assets/stage5/image5.png":cs,"./full/assets/stage5/image6.png":ds,"./full/assets/stage5/image7.png":ms,"./full/assets/stage5/image8.png":us});let t=p=>I["./full/assets/"+p];ks();var r=As(),l=a(bs(r),16),c=a(s(l),2),d=s(c),o=s(d),k=s(o);e(o);var m=a(o,2),A=s(m);e(m),e(d),e(c),e(l);var g=a(l,2),u=a(s(g),2),F=s(u);e(u),e(g);var n=a(g,2),v=a(s(n),2),U=s(v);e(v),e(n);var h=a(n,2),f=a(s(h),2),b=s(f),_=s(b),T=s(_);e(_);var y=a(_,2),P=s(y);e(y),e(b),e(f),e(h),Is(10),ys((p,H,E,O,X,j)=>{i(k,"src",p),i(A,"src",H),i(F,"src",E),i(U,"src",O),i(T,"src",X),i(P,"src",j)},[()=>t("empathy-maps/george.svg"),()=>t("demographics-graphs/age.png"),()=>t("stage3/mindmap.png"),()=>t("stage4/low-fidelity.png"),()=>t("stage4/u7.png"),()=>t("stage4/u4.png")],xs),vs(w,r),ws()}export{Os as component};
